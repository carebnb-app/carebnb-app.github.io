								<h2>A dramatic turnaround</h2>
								<p class="lead">
									Airbnb bookings are starting to grow again in U.S., as travel demand starts recovering.
								</p>
								<p>
									Covid-19 seems already to be in the past of many U.S. Airbnb managers.
									Airbnb revealed that it had more US bookings between May 17 and June 3, 
									which encompassed Memorial Day on May 25, than the same time period a year earlier. 
									That signals Americans are ready to travel, albeit primarily within the United States.
									<blockquote>
										“Domestic vacation rentals
										- people are itching to get out of their homes but not yet ready to get on a plane.”
									</blockquote>
									<div class="text-right">
										- Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital and an early Airbnb investor.
									</div>
								</p>
								<p>
									CEO Brian Chesky said he’s noticed travelers are preferring to stick to drivable domestic destinations within 200 miles of their home. 
									The malaise of international travel restrictions is making it difficult for people to explore outside of their home countries.
								</p>
								<p>
									The uptick in bookings is a dramatic turnaround from where the start-up found itself just a few months earlier, when nearly every state in the U.S. was on lockdown and air travel had nearly ground to a halt, with the Transportation Security Administration passenger count below 110,000 for 17 consecutive days from April 6 through 22.
								</p>
								<p>
									<blockquote>
										“When we started Airbnb, it was about belonging and connection.
										This crisis has sharpened our focus to get back to our roots, back to the basics,
										back to what is truly special about Airbnb
										- everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences,”
									</blockquote>
									<div class="text-right">
										- Brian Chesky, co-founder and CEO, in a letter to his employees on May 5.

								</p>
								<p>
									To get out of Covid-19 crises,
									Airbnb implemented measures to keep its guests and hosts happy, 
									but the result was a wave of criticism for seemingly every step it took.

								<p>
									First, Airbnb offered to refund the full cost of bookings for periods where 
									locations were locked down to stop the pandemic from spreading. 
									But some guests said they faced difficulty collecting the full cash refunds 
									and took to social media to complain.
								</p>


								<h2>IPO hopes revived</h2>
								<p>
									Despite the most dramatic period in Airbnb’s all-time history, hopes for a 2020 IPO are being revived.
								</p>
								<p>
									Domestic travel is beginning to pick up again
									— albeit from a very low base — 
									and the recent first-day pop of ZoomInfo’s IPO in the middle of the pandemic has whetted investors’ appetites.
									Other long-private companies, including Palantir and Amwell, have recently filed confidential plans to IPO
									and could signal the beginning of a new wave.
								</p>
								<p>
									In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month, Chesky was noncommittal but said, 
									“We’re not ruling out going public this year.”
								</p>
								<p>
									Ron Conway, founder and co-managing partner of SV Angel and an early Airbnb investor, 
									says guests have picked Airbnb as the safe option over hotels. 
									“It is really clear that people want housing they have control over,” he says. 
									“That is a huge learning. Guests trust Airbnb.”
								</p>
								

								<h2>
									How hosts are getting ready for post Covid-19
								</h2>
								<p>
									The time for bold solutions is now.
									The world as we know it is in flux. 
									All normal systems of how we live our lives, get our food, 
									work and socialize have been interrupted because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
								</p>
								<p>
									Cutting-edge automation systems are emerging from Covid-19 crisis.
									Automation systems like <a href="https://carebnb.app">Carebnb.app</a> can increase Airbnb listings occupancy rate by up tp 90%.
								</p>
								<p>
									Hosts all around the world are adhering Airbnb automation
									- the process of optimizing recurring tasks to increase efficiency and minimize costs.
									These automations include answering guests inquiries, creating custom access codes, coordinating cleanings, and more.
									Automation allows hosts to organize many of your daily operations so that you no longer need to do them yourself.
