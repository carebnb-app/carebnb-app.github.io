<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  Effective date: March 9, 2021
  <br />
  Welcome to <strong>Carebnb</strong> ("<strong>Carebnb</strong>," "we," "us" or "our").
  <strong>Carebnb</strong> provides a cutting edge Airbnb automation ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and
  protect information in relation to our tools, mobile services, web site, apps and any software provided
  on or in connection with <strong>Carebnb</strong> services (collectively, the "Service"), and your
  choices about the collection and use of your information.
</p>
<p>
  By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing an automation tool where somehow
  you inform and share some of your personal information ("User Content") to the Service and to share
  User Content publicly.
</p>
<p>
  Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").
  Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use,
  protect or otherwise handle your Personal Data when accessing and/or using our website and services.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
    We collect the following types of information.
    <p>
      Information you provide us directly:
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email, phone number, mailing address, Airbnb ID</li>
        <li>
          Communications between you and <strong>Carebnb</strong>. 
          For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,
          changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).
          Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Analytics information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.
          These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you
          visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service.
          We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so
          that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Device identifiers:
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,
          collect, monitor, tore on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers."
          Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with
          your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data
          stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's
          operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by <strong>Carebnb</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you
          browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content
          and ads.
          Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device
          identifiers is impaired or disabled.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>
    We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside <strong>Carebnb</strong> (or the

    <p>
      Parties with whom we may share your information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from
          cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are
          legally part of the same group of companies that <strong>Carebnb</strong> is part of, or that
          become part of that group ("Affiliates").
          Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service
          (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you
          with better and more relevant experiences).
        </li>

          We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files,

          provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.
          This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
          advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.
          We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer
          associated with you and share that aggregated information.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens in the event of a change of control:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of <strong>Carebnb</strong> or our assets
          to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition,
          bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User
          Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold
          or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have
          to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

      </ul>
    </p>

      Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a
          search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires
          us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the
          United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that
          jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally
          recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good
          faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity;
          to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death
          or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and
          retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation,
          governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or
          policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.
